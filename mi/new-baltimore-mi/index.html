            <h3>New Baltimore, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>New Baltimore incorporated as a village in 1867 and as a city in 1931. Previously, it was split between Macomb and St. Clair counties; however, in the 1970s, the city was able to petition to adjust the county boundaries such that it would align with the city's eastern border. This placed New Baltimore completely in Macomb County, where it remains to this day. The town sits on the waterfront along Lake St. Clair's Anchor Bay, and offers a public park, beach, and downtown-shopping district.</p>
