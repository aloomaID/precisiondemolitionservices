            <h3>Mastic Beach, NY Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In 2010, a group of residents sought to incorporate Mastic Beach as a village. Petitioners blamed the town of Brookhaven for not doing enough code enforcement on blighted streets and eyesore buildings, believing more diligent code enforcement under village control would improve the community aesthetics. Opponents were concerned that creating the village would increase taxes, and that estimates for the proposed village's total budget were low. At $549,500 annually, the village would take up building code enforcement, leaving police, fire, and sanitation to Brookhaven.</p>
